In this project, I have to make the index.HTML page functional.

Step 1: On page load, first text box will be ready to type in.
	-COMPLETE-

Step 2: In the drop down labeled 'Job Role', when the option 'Other' is chosen, the text box
labeled 'Your Job Role' should be showing. Must be hidden on any other option.
	-COMPLETE-

Step 3: In the t-shirt dropdown, show certain selections in the color dropdown while certain
selections are made. Made changes so a default option is shown for choosing a color.
	-COMPLETE-

Step 4: Activity Registration. Events are set at the same time.
If one is selected that has a certain time, another with the
same time must be disabled.
Unchecked? Re-enabled. As activities are selected,
a running total must be shown.
